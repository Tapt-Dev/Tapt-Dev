Hello, I'm Tapt.
I am a Roblox developer and I have worked on numerous projects on the website (Although none of them are publicly accessible yet). 
I’m currently learning multiple programming languages including Roblox Lua, C++, Python, Javascript, and Java.
I’m looking to collaborate on any Roblox project.
You can reach me by emailing me at taptdev@gmail.com
